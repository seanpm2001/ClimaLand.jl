One just needs to write a new model type (e.g. BiophysicsModel <: AbstractModel for a vegetation and carbon component model) and the appropriate interaction methods for that model.\nthe order in which the components are treated in the rhs or in update aux does not matter. What matters is that auxiliary/cache variables are updated first, and within this update, interactions are updated last. We assume that the rhs! function for a component only needs the entire p and Y.component in making this statement.
